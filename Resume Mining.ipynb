It's process for automatic manipulating of natural language, like speech and text processing by a software.Every Organization have a recuitement process in which they need to they have to filter or short list the top ranked candidates from a long list of candidates and that is a very very time consuming process. To solve this problem a tool called NLP come into play and rank  the candidate profile based on their skills, expericnce and education.Recuitement Agencies and corporate companies numerous resumes daily, which is very tedious and time consuming task.Our purpose is to design a model that can parse information from unstractured resumes and transform it to a strractured JSON format, Also, Present the extracted resumes to the employer, based on the job description.\n"

He  has  pursued  research  in  the  fields  of  rotational  spectroscopy  of  molecules,  electron  spin  resonance,  molecular  orbital  ~alculations,  microwave  properties  of  materials,  and  non-linear  optical  spectroscopy.  A  number  of  projects  were  performed  in  conjunction  with  efforts  at  the  Naval  Weapons  Center,  China  Lake,  the  Naval  Research  Laboratory,  Washington,  D.C.,  and  the  University  of  Southern  California.  Specific  applications  of  fundamental  studies  pursued  include  measurements  of  properties  of  possible  propellants,  the  production  of  materials  with  specific  microwave  properties,  and  the  development  of  new  diagnostic  instrumentation  for  chemical  analysis.

    "### Lemmatization\n",
    "In NLP, lemmatization is a procedure of organising the altered form of a word, such that their analysis can take place as a single term, identified by the word's dictionary form (lemma). In NLP, the procedure of concluding the lemma of a word depending upon its predetermined meaning. It depends on rightly identifying the predetermined part of speech and what a word in a sentence means, as well as in a bigger situation surrounding the sentences, which can include neighboring sentences, and even an entire document, which contradicts stemming. So, an algorithm of lemmatization is an open platform for research"
